          <h2>What is Markdown?</h2>
          <p>
            Markdown is a lightweight markup language that you can use to add
            formatting elements to plaintext text documents. Created by<a
              href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"
              target="_blank"
            >
              John Gruber
            </a>
            in 2004, Markdown is now one of the world’s most popular markup
            languages.
          </p>

          <p>
            Using Markdown is different than using a
            <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/WYSIWYG" target="_blank"
              >WYSIWYG</a
            >
            editor. In an application like Microsoft Word, you click buttons to
            format words and phrases, and the changes are visible immediately.
            Markdown isn’t like that. When you create a Markdown-formatted file,
            you add Markdown syntax to the text to indicate which words and
            phrases should look different.
          </p>

          <p>
            For example, to denote a heading, you add a number sign before it
            (e.g., # Heading One). Or to make a phrase bold, you add two
            asterisks before and after it (e.g., **this text is bold**). It may
            take a while to get used to seeing Markdown syntax in your text,
            especially if you’re accustomed to WYSIWYG applications. The
            screenshot below shows a Markdown file displayed in the
            <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/" target="_blank">
              Visual Studio Code
            </a>
            text editor.
          </p>

              alt="VScode preview"
            />
          </picture>

          <p>
            You can add Markdown formatting elements to a plaintext file using a
            text editor application. Or you can use one of the many Markdown
            applications for macOS, Windows, Linux, iOS, and Android operating
            systems. There are also several web-based applications specifically
            designed for writing in Markdown.
          </p>

          <p>
            Depending on the application you use, you may not be able to preview
            the formatted document in real time. But that’s okay.<a
              href="https://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/"
              target="_blank"
            >
              According to Gruber </a
            >, Markdown syntax is designed to be readable and unobtrusive, so
            the text in Markdown files can be read even if it isn’t rendered.
          </p>

          <p class="notes">
            The overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to
            make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a
            Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain
            text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or
            formatting instructions.

          <h2>Why Use Markdown?</h2>
          <p>
            You might be wondering why people use Markdown instead of a WYSIWYG
            editor. Why write with Markdown when you can press buttons in an
            interface to format your text? As it turns out, there are several
            reasons why people use Markdown instead of WYSIWYG editors.
          </p>

          <ul>
            <li>
              <p>
                Markdown can be used for everything. People use it to create
                <a href="#websites">websites</a>,
                <a href="#documents">documents</a>, <a href="#notes">notes</a>,

            <li>
              <p>
                Markdown is portable. Files containing Markdown-formatted text
                can be opened using virtually any application. If you decide you
                don’t like the Markdown application you’re currently using, you
                can import your Markdown files into another Markdown
                application. That’s in stark contrast to word processing
                applications like Microsoft Word that lock your content into a
                proprietary file format.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Markdown is platform independent. You can create
                Markdown-formatted text on any device running any operating
                system.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Markdown is future proof. Even if the application you’re using
                stops working at some point in the future, you’ll still be able
                to read your Markdown-formatted text using a text editing
                application. This is an important consideration when it comes to
                books, university theses, and other milestone documents that
                need to be preserved indefinitely.
              </p>

                Markdown is everywhere. Websites like
                <a href="https://www.markdownguide.org/tools/reddit/">Reddit</a>
                and GitHub support Markdown, and lots of desktop and web-based
                applications support it.

            The best way to get started with Markdown is to use it. That’s
            easier than ever before thanks to a variety of free tools.
          </p>

          <p>
            You don’t even need to download anything. There are several online
            Markdown editors that you can use to try writing in Markdown.
            <a href="https://dillinger.io/">Dillinger</a> is one of the best
            online Markdown editors. Just open the site and start typing in the
            left pane. A preview of the rendered document appears in the right
            pane.

          <p>
            You’ll probably want to keep the Dillinger website open as you read
            through this guide. That way you can try the syntax as you learn
            about it. After you’ve become familiar with Markdown, you may want
            to use a Markdown application that can be installed on your desktop
            computer or mobile device.

          <h2>How Does it Work?</h2>
          <p>
            Dillinger makes writing in Markdown easy because it hides the stuff
            happening behind the scenes, but it’s worth exploring how the
            process works in general.
          </p>

          <p>
            When you write in Markdown, the text is stored in a plaintext file
            that has an .md or .markdown extension. But then what? How is your
            Markdown-formatted file converted into HTML or a print-ready
            document?
          </p>

          <p>
            The short answer is that you need a Markdown application capable of
            processing the Markdown file. There are lots of applications
            available — everything from simple scripts to desktop applications
            that look like Microsoft Word. Despite their visual differences, all
            of the applications do the same thing. Like Dillinger, they all
            convert Markdown-formatted text to HTML so it can be displayed in
            web browsers.
          </p>

          <p>
            Markdown applications use something called a Markdown processor
            (also commonly referred to as a “parser” or an “implementation”) to
            take the Markdown-formatted text and output it to HTML format. At
            that point, your document can be viewed in a web browser or combined
            with a style sheet and printed. You can see a visual representation
            of this process below.
          </p>

          <p class="notes">
            Note: The Markdown application and processor are two separate
            components. For the sake of brevity, I've combined them into one
            element ("Markdown app") in the figure below.
          </p>

              alt="Markdown Flowchart"
            />
          </picture>

          <p>To summarize, this is a four-part process:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>
              <p>
                Create a Markdown file using a text editor or a dedicated
                Markdown application. The file should have an .md or .markdown
                extension.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>Open the Markdown file in a Markdown application.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                Use the Markdown application to convert the Markdown file to an
                HTML document.
              </p>
            </li>
            <li>
              <p>
                View the HTML file in a web browser or use the Markdown
                application to convert it to another file format, like PDF.
              </p>
            </li>
          </ol>

          <p>
            From your perspective, the process will vary somewhat depending on
            the application you use. For example, Dillinger essentially combines
            steps 1-3 into a single, seamless interface — all you have to do is
            type in the left pane and the rendered output magically appears in
            the right pane. But if you use other tools, like a text editor with
            a static website generator, you’ll find that the process is much
            more visible.

          <h2>What’s Markdown Good For?</h2>
          <p>
            Markdown is a fast and easy way to take notes, create content for a
            website, and produce print-ready documents.
          </p>

          <p>
            It doesn’t take long to learn the Markdown syntax, and once you know
            how to use it, you can write using Markdown just about everywhere.
            Most people use Markdown to create content for the web, but Markdown
            is good for formatting everything from email messages to grocery
            lists.
          </p>

          <p>Here are some examples of what you can do with Markdown.</p>

          <h2>Websites</h2>
          <p>
            Markdown was designed for the web, so it should come as no surprise
            that there are plenty of applications specifically designed for
            creating website content.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you’re looking for the simplest possible way to create a website
            with Markdown files, check out blot.im. After you sign up for Blot,
            it creates a Dropbox folder on your computer. Just drag and drop
            your Markdown files into the folder and — poof! — they’re on your
            website. It couldn’t be easier.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you’re familiar with HTML, CSS, and version control, check out
            Jekyll, a popular static site generator that takes Markdown files
            and builds an HTML website. One advantage to this approach is that
            GitHub Pages provides free hosting for Jekyll-generated websites. If
            Jekyll isn’t your cup of tea, just pick one of the many other static
            site generators available.
          </p>

          <p class="notes">
            Note: I used Jekyll to create the Markdown Guide. You can view the
            source code on GitHub.

          <p>
            If you’d like to use a content management system (CMS) to power your
            website, take a look at Ghost. It’s a free and open-source blogging
            platform with a nice Markdown editor. If you’re a WordPress user,
            you’ll be happy to know there’s Markdown support for websites hosted
            on WordPress.com. Self-hosted WordPress sites can use the Jetpack
            plugin.

            Markdown doesn’t have all the bells and whistles of word processors
            like Microsoft Word, but it’s good enough for creating basic
            documents like assignments and letters. You can use a Markdown
            document authoring application to create and export
            Markdown-formatted documents to PDF or HTML file format. The PDF
            part is key, because once you have a PDF document, you can do
            anything with it — print it, email it, or upload it to a website.

          <p>
            In nearly every way, Markdown is the ideal syntax for taking notes.
            Sadly, Evernote and OneNote, two of the most popular note
            applications, don’t currently support Markdown. The good news is
            that several other note applications do support Markdown:
          </p>

            <li>
              <p>
                Obsidian is a popular Markdown note-taking application loaded
                with features.

                Bear is an Evernote-like application available for Mac and iOS
                devices. It doesn’t exclusively use Markdown by default, but you
                can enable Markdown compatibility mode.

            Believe it or not, you can generate presentations from
            Markdown-formatted files. Creating presentations in Markdown takes a
            little getting used to, but once you get the hang of it, it’s a lot
            faster and easier than using an application like PowerPoint or
            Keynote. Remark (GitHub project) is a popular browser-based Markdown
            slideshow tool, as are Cleaver (GitHub project) and Marp (GitHub
            project). If you use a Mac and would prefer to use an application,

            Collaboration and team messaging applications are a popular way of

            applications don’t utilize all of Markdown’s features, but the
            features they do provide are fairly useful. For example, the ability
            to bold and italicize text without using the WYSIWYG interface is
            pretty handy. Slack, Discord, Wiki.js, and Mattermost are all good
            collaboration applications.

            Markdown is a natural fit for technical documentation. Companies

          <h2>Flavors of Markdown</h2>
          <p>
            One of the most confusing aspects of using Markdown is that
            practically every Markdown application implements a slightly
            different version of Markdown. These variants of Markdown are
            commonly referred to as flavors. It’s your job to master whatever
            flavor of Markdown your application has implemented.
          </p>

          <p>
            To wrap your head around the concept of Markdown flavors, it might
            help to think of them as language dialects. People in New York City
            speak English just like the people in London, but there are
            substantial differences between the dialects used in both cities.
            The same is true for people using different Markdown applications.
            Using Dillinger to write with Markdown is a vastly different
            experience than using Ulysses.
          </p>

          <p>
            Practically speaking, this means you never know exactly what a
            company means when they say they support “Markdown.” Are they
            talking about only the basic syntax elements, or all of the basic
            and extended syntax elements combined, or some arbitrary combination
            of syntax elements? You won’t know until you read the documentation
            or start using the application.
          </p>

          <p>
            If you’re just starting out, the best advice I can give you is to
            pick a Markdown application with good Markdown support. That’ll go a
            long way towards maintaining the portability of your Markdown files.
            You might want to store and use your Markdown files in other
            applications, and to do that you need to start with an application
            that provides good support. You can use the tool directory to find
            an application that fits the bill.
